Which of the following are objects in Ruby? If they are objects, how can you find out what class they belong to?

1. `true`
2. `"hello"`
3. `[1, 2, 3, "happy days"}]`
4. 142

Answer: All of them are objects! Everything in Ruby is an object!

```ruby

true.class                       # TrueClass
"hello".class                    # String
[1, 2, 3, "happy days"].class    # Array
142.class                        # Integer

```
