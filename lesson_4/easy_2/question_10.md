What are the benefits of using OOP in Ruby?
- Helps organize large, complex software systems.
- OOP provides a way to create containers that can be changed without affecting the entire program.
- It allows you to section off areas of code that performs specific procedures to that programs could become the interaction of many small parts instead of one huge blob of dependency.
- Creating object allows programmers to think more abstractly about the code they are writing.
- Objects are represented by nouns so are easier to conceptualize.
- We can build applications faster since we can reuse pre-written code.
- It allows us to easily give functionality to different parts of an application without duplication.
- It allows us to only expose functionality to the parts of code that need it, meaning namespace issues are much harder to come across.
